# solana-pay-request

A ZeroClaw **WIT tool plugin** that builds a [Solana Pay](https://docs.solanapay.com/spec)
transfer-request URL for a SOL or SPL-token payment — a link or QR code a human's
wallet scans and signs. It implements the `tool-plugin` world from `wit/v0` and
compiles to a `wasm32-wasip2` component.

It is the **zero-custody** answer to *"how should an autonomous agent handle money?"*:
the agent **proposes** a payment; the human's wallet **disposes**. The plugin never
holds a key and never touches the network.

## What it does

One tool, `solana_pay_request`. Given a recipient (and optionally an amount, SPL
mint, label, message, memo, and reference keys), it returns a spec-compliant URL:

```
solana:<recipient>?amount=<amount>&spl-token=<mint>&reference=<ref>&label=<label>&message=<message>&memo=<memo>
```

Example — the agent turns *"invoice ertan 25 USDC for table 4"* into:

```json
{ "recipient": "9WzD...pump", "amount": "25", "spl_token": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
  "label": "Table 4", "message": "Dinner" }
```
→ `solana:9WzD...pump?amount=25&spl-token=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&label=Table%204&message=Dinner`

Render it as a QR in the chat; the payer scans it in Phantom/Solflare and signs.
No key ever leaves the human.

## Custody tier — **T1 (zero-custody, agent-proposes)**

| | |
|---|---|
| Holds a private key? | **No.** |
| Can it move funds on its own? | **No.** It emits a *request*; a human signs. |
| Network egress? | **None** (`permissions = []`; the component imports no `wasi:http`). |
| Config read? | **None.** Output depends only on the validated call arguments. |

This is the safest possible way to claim the "transacting agents on Solana"
thesis: the money genuinely moves on-chain in a live demo, but the agent's blast
radius is exactly zero — it can only ever *ask*.

## Threat model

The attacker is a **prompt injection** in the agent's context (a poisoned web
page, email, or tool output) trying to redirect or forge a payment.

- **Wrong recipient?** The `recipient` is validated as a real 32-byte base58 key
  and echoed **verbatim** into the URL path — never rewritten, defaulted, or
  dropped. An injection that stuffs an attacker address into `label`/`message`
  changes only inert, percent-encoded display text; the true recipient still
  shows in the wallet before the human signs. (Test:
  `recipient_is_never_rewritten_by_a_poisoned_label`.)
- **Silent auto-send?** Impossible by construction — there is no signer and no
  RPC. The human is always the last step.
- **Malformed / hostile input?** The tool **fails closed**: any invalid recipient,
  amount, mint, or reference returns `success:false` with a reason and **no URL**,
  rather than emitting a plausible-but-wrong request. (Tests: the `*_fails_closed`
  suite.)
- **Trust boundary:** whatever the human's wallet displays *is* the transaction.
  This plugin's job is to never let the URL and the human's understanding diverge.

## Parameters

| field | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `recipient` | yes | base58 address to be paid |
| `amount` | no | SOL amount, or SPL-token UI units if `spl_token` set (non-negative decimal string) |
| `spl_token` | no | SPL mint; omit for native SOL |
| `reference` | no | array of base58 reference keys for later lookup |
| `label` | no | who is requesting (shown in wallet) |
| `message` | no | what it's for (shown in wallet) |
| `memo` | no | on-chain SPL memo |

## Layout (the reference format)

```
src/pay.rs      # pure URL-builder + validation, no wasm deps — host-testable
src/lib.rs      # thin #[cfg(target_family = "wasm")] component shim; logs via log-record
tests/pay.rs    # host-run golden-vector + fails-closed tests
manifest.toml   # tool, zero permissions
```

## Build and test

```bash
cargo test                                            # 12 host tests, no wasm needed
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release          # the component
cp target/wasm32-wasip2/release/solana_pay_request.wasm solana_pay_request.wasm
wasm-tools component wit solana_pay_request.wasm      # exports tool + plugin-info; imports logging only (no wasi:http)
```

## Install

```bash
zeroclaw plugin install solana-pay-request
zeroclaw config set plugins.enabled true
```

or copy this directory (the `.wasm` next to `manifest.toml`) into your plugins dir.
Run the host with `--features plugins-wasm,plugins-wasm-cranelift`.

## What fought us on `wasm32-wasip2`

Almost nothing — **because we refused to hold a key.** The pain in Solana-in-wasm
is elsewhere (the old monolithic `solana-sdk`/`solana-client` won't compile to
`wasm32-wasip2`; you need the granular `solana-program`/`solana-message` crates).
A transfer-*request* sidesteps all of it: it's pure string construction over a
validated base58 key, so the only dependency is `bs58`. The one real subtlety is
**percent-encoding** — `label`/`message`/`memo` are free-form UTF-8 and must be
RFC-3986 encoded (a hand-rolled encoder here) while the base58 `recipient`/`mint`/
`reference` values must be left verbatim in the URL.

## What we'd build next

- **`unsigned-transfer`** (still T1): assemble a full unsigned SOL/SPL transaction
  (`solana-program` + a recent blockhash) and hand back the base64 message for a
  human or a **Squads** multisig to sign — the same zero-custody stance, one step
  deeper into "the agent handled the money."
- A **T2 sign-and-submit** tool is deliberately *not* here: holding a keypair puts
  the whole agent one prompt-injection away from a drained wallet. If ever built,
  it belongs behind a hardware signer or a Squads policy (spend caps, allow-lists,
  human co-sign), never a bare key in config.
